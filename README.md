# Customer Churn and Retention Analysis

Built an end-to-end customer churn analytics solution using Brazil's Olist e-commerce dataset (93K+ customers), combining customer segmentation, churn-risk prediction, and targeted retention strategies to identify at-risk customers, protect R$3M+ in revenue, and improve retention ROI.

## Objective

- Identify **who** is likely to stop buying (churn-risk prediction).
- Understand **why** customers leave (delivery performance, satisfaction, spend behaviour).
- Segment customers by value and behaviour (RFM scoring and K-Means clustering).
- Quantify the **revenue at risk** and map each customer to a targeted retention action.

-- Run the notebooks in order: `data_cleaning` > `eda_and_segmentation` > `churn_model`. Each one reads from and writes to the `Data/` folder, so set `drive_path` at the top of each notebook to your `Data/` location. 
-- olist_cleaned_items.csv is generated after running data_cleaning and is used for eda_segementation and model training.
-- Dataset: [Olist Brazilian E-Commerce on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).

## Insights & Outcomes

- **Delivery performance is the strongest churn signal.** A cluster of about 6,200 customers has a 99% late-delivery rate and a 2.26 average review score, against 4.0 to 4.3 elsewhere.
- **Most customers buy only once.** Revenue and orders kept growing, so the problem is retention, not falling demand.
- **About R$6.8M of R$15.4M revenue is at risk**, with Loyal customers holding the most (R$3.02M) and At-risk customers the highest share (46.0%).
- **3,107 high-value customers** (Champions and Loyal at 60%+ churn probability) are flagged for personal outreach.
- **Every customer gets a retention action**, from VIP recovery to automated win-back emails.

> **Caveat:** the churn model is weak (ROC-AUC 0.56), so use the scores to prioritize outreach, not to forecast.
